# Sharp Blade - Blender Themes

**Easy on the eyes, deep in the blue. Create freely.**

Welcome to the official repository for the **Sharp Blade** theme collection. This repository hosts the latest versions of the Sharp Blade themes for Blender, designed to provide a professional, high-contrast, and distraction-free environment for 3D artists.

## 🎨 About the Theme

### Key Characteristics

* **High Contrast Viewport:** 3D elements pop against the background for precise modeling.
* **Low Contrast Panels:** UI panels are subtle, keeping the focus on your work.
* **Accented Popups:** Menus and active tools are highlighted for quick navigation.

### Sharp Blade v5 (Latest)
